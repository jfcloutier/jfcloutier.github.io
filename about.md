![Me](/assets/jf.jpg "JFC")

My name is **Jean-Fran√ßois Cloutier**. I have been a software developer for a while now. I fell in love with programming in the 80s and I never fell out.

I have coded in many languages but mostly in Prolog, Smalltalk, Java, and now, [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org).

I am grateful to all of you who are taking the time to blog about your own discoveries. It's about time I start returning the favor.
